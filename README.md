# train-schedule

If you're waiting for a train, this app can tell you when the next train will arrive and how many minutes away it is. 

Just type in the train name, your destination, the first train time--what time the first train of the day arrived--and the frequency--number of minutes between trains. 

Sit back and watch the train schedule update!

Technologies used to make this app are Firebase, HTML5, CSS, Moment.js, Bootstrap, JQuery and JavaScript.
